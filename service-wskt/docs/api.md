# WebSocket API

## About

## Deployment

To deploy and start the service, follow these steps:

1. Install all dependencies in the root directory 'service-wskt'.
2. If not already done, compile TypeScript scripts in the 'src' directory. This generates a 'build' directory mirroring 'src'.
3. Copy the '.env' file to the 'build' directory and update parameters specific to your environment.
4. Run the 'server.js' file in the 'build' directory as the entry point of the application.
